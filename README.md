## Description
A simple CRUD application using [mySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) for database.
This is part of the series of exercises to practice MERN stack.

I will later on replace the mySQL part with [MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) to demonstrate that independence of the front-end side to the server.

This application handles the server operation of a simple Todo app.
